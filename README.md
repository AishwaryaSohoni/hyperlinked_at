A Hyperlinked Authoring Tool : hyperlinked_at
==============

This authoring tool is built in Java. It allows the user to import a primary and a secondary video in a JFrame, create
hyperlinks between them. There can be multiple hyperlinks in a primary video. The information of all the hyperlinks in 
the primary video would be written into a meta file called <PrimaryVideoName>.meta The user could do this over and over
again to create a chain of videos. They can be played using the supplementary hyperlinked video player.
